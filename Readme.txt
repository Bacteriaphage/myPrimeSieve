This program is a simple version to count primes which do not have digit "7".

We write this program in Visual Studio 2015 and test it on X64 machine.

Please make sure don`t use X86 machine to run this program!!!  



You can use the Makefile I have provided to compile this program, or you

can write your own makefile to compile it, I highly recommend you to write

your own because I cannot use "touch" in windows. Anyway this makefile works

correctly in linux.



All test results I have figured out is based on following device:

CPU: i3 4150

Memory: 8GB

Environment: Visual Studio 2015 

Configuration: Release version, X64
